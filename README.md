In the works :D

## **Development Log**

-   23/24 May: I spent a lot of time figuring out my tech stack for this project. Initially I wanted to use PIXI with my usual tech stack, but I realised the react version of PIXI was too hard to integrate in. Then I decided to go with plain html/js/css and p5play. After figuring things out for a while, I realised that the documentation for p5play was quite sad, and was very difficult to work with. So after even more fiddling, I finally settled on a typescript + firebase + pixi-ts build. Quite happy with it. Pixi really does have good docs compared to those in p5play!

-   5 Jun: Got multiplayer hooked up, so the app can use it. Progress is slow... working on FEs first LOL. Hopefully can start work next week

-   13 Jun: Well, I bit off way more than I can chew, I don't think I can afford to do multiplayer, unfortunately. Welp. Its ok, imma focus on the actual project.
